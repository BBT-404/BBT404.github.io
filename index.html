  <p>Welcome! Feel free to peruse my portfolio work <ahref = "">here</ahref> (currently a work in progress, courtesy of a second migration of my portfolio to GitHub).

I'm someone who's long been interested in computing and computer games, and decided to choose Games Design to to unite the adjacent interests. My experience started in Scratch in 2015 and from then, I have learnt Python, Pygame, then Unity and more recently Unreal.</p>
